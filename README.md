## Lattice-Based Modelling of Beam Dynamics 

A lattice-based model with Euler-Bernoulli beam elements to study the property of metamaterials.

### Files

This repository includes example scripts for a beam under the following conditions:  
1. Clamped-Free
2. Free-Free

A `Class` is defined for the lattice structure including data about node locations, mesh connections, element lengths, areas, elasticity moduli, and functions applying loads and constraints with an Implicit Newmark-Beta numerical solver. Additional scripts are included to study transfer of energy and frequencies of resonance and antiresonance.
